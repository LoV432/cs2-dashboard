# CS2 Server Dashboard

## Overview

A very basic CounterStrike 2 Server Dashboard!

## Features

- **Connected Players**: Monitor all players with details like ping, packet loss, name, and IP.
- **IP Lookup**: Optionally view IP details such as country, city, ASN, and ASN number.
- **Admin Actions**: A quick and easy way to kick/(un)ban/slay/(un)mute players using [CS2-SimpleAdmin](https://github.com/daffyyyy/CS2-SimpleAdmin) plugin.
- **Console**: Execute RCON commands with some basic auto-complete suggestions.

## Installation

The recommended way to use this is through Docker and Docker Compose. I have provided 2 example docker-compose files.
1) [Standalone](https://github.com/LoV432/cs2-dashboard/blob/master/examples/docker-compose.yml)
2) [Dashboard with CS2](https://github.com/LoV432/cs2-dashboard/blob/master/examples/docker-compose-with-cs2.yml)
